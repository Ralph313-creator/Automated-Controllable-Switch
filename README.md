Instruction will be added soon or email: rap.ocba@gmail.com

Prerequisites

Everything in this tutorial is the end product of what I've learned so far about the Raspberry Pi and some things i learned with JavaScript and Python. If you get stuck anywhere, just email me or follow this simple steps to get started:

    Headless Raspberry Pi
    https://www.easyprogramming.net/raspberrypi/headless_raspbery_pi.php
    
    Using the RPi.GPIO library to turn on an LED
    https://github.com/Ralph313-creator/Automated-Switch/blob/master/test.py
    
    Running a Flask App on your Pi
    https://www.easyprogramming.net/raspberrypi/pi_flask_app_server.php
    
Installation

Since we are running RPi.GPIO from a virtual environment, we need ato take one extr step after activating venv and install the package:

pip3 install RPi.GPIO

We need to do this because our virtual environment can't access the globally installed RPi.GPIO package
